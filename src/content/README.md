Files in this folder should be written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-syntax inside the JavaScript export ticks. The files are currently still .js-files because of reasons, but don't let that disturb.

Format example:

    export default `
    # Header
    Some body and a [link-to-google](https://google.com).
    `;
